                <b>The Hunger's Kitchen </b> is a website whose idea was brought-up by four college friends when
                they saw food wastage in their society and found out that there is no proper measure for it's
                management. <br> That was the kick for the idea of making something that the environment and we need.

                <u><b>OUR MISSION</b></u><br><br>
                Our mission is to stop the death-cycle caused due to hunger. It includes bringing food to the plates of
                the needy and not letting anyone sleep with empty stomaches another night blaming one's life. <br>
                <br>
                Our Vision is to stop or in the least reduce the deaths due to starvation around us.
